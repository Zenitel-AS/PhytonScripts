# Python scripts to show how to connect as a Zenitel Link user

There are 3 Python scripts:

* subscribe.py
* call.py
* call_wamp.py
 
All scripts can be started by the following command:

* scriptname.py IP-address-of-Zenitel-Connect Zenitel-Link-username Zenitel-Link-password

To run the scripts succesfully, both ports 80 and 8087 must be open.
